- **YARA Rules**: Malware detection and file analysis capabilities
- **STIX Patterns**: Structured threat intelligence indicators
- **Custom Rule Templates**: Organization-specific detection formats

### 2. Advanced Analytics & Intelligence
- **ML-Powered IOC Scoring**: Confidence and risk assessment using machine learning
- **Threat Actor Attribution**: Link IOCs to known threat groups and campaigns
- **Attack Pattern Analysis**: Automated MITRE ATT&CK technique mapping
- **Predictive Threat Modeling**: Forecast potential attack vectors

### 3. Enterprise CTI Integration
- **Tier 1 Enterprise APIs**: Recorded Future, CrowdStrike Falcon X, Mandiant
- **Government Feeds**: US-CERT, CISA, sector-specific intelligence
- **Commercial Threat Intel**: FireEye, Proofpoint, ThreatConnect
- **Real-time Feed Processing**: Automated IOC ingestion and correlation

### 4. Community & Collaboration
- **Shared Hunt Packs**: Community-contributed detection templates
- **Threat Intelligence Marketplace**: Vetted IOC and rule sharing
- **Collaborative Workspaces**: Team-based threat hunting projects
- **Knowledge Base**: Crowdsourced threat intelligence documentation

### 5. Detection Engineering Workflow
- **Rule Testing Framework**: Automated validation across multiple platforms
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Rule efficiency and false positive analysis
- **Version Control**: Git-like versioning for detection rules
- **Deployment Pipeline**: Automated rule distribution to SIEM platforms

## Technical Architecture

### Rule Generation Engine
```typescript
interface RuleGenerator {
  generateSigma(iocs: IOC[], context: ThreatContext): SigmaRule;
  generateYARA(samples: FileSample[], metadata: MalwareMetadata): YARARule;
  generateSTIX(intelligence: ThreatIntel): STIXPattern;
  validateRule(rule: DetectionRule, platform: string): ValidationResult;
}
```

### ML Analytics Pipeline
```typescript
interface MLAnalytics {
  scoreIOC(ioc: string, context: ThreatContext): ConfidenceScore;
  attributeThreatActor(iocs: IOC[], techniques: ATTACKTechnique[]): Attribution;
  predictAttackVector(indicators: ThreatIndicator[]): AttackPrediction;
  clusterThreats(intelligence: ThreatIntel[]): ThreatCluster[];
}
```

### Enterprise CTI Service
```typescript
interface EnterpriseCTI {
  providers: EnterpriseProvider[];
  ingestFeed(provider: string, config: APIConfig): Promise<ThreatFeed>;
  correlateThreat(ioc: string): Promise<ThreatCorrelation>;
  enrichWithContext(indicators: IOC[]): Promise<EnrichedIntelligence>;
}
```
